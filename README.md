# What we learned in lesson 3 today
Today we leraned about several things.

## Local Repository Structure

The local Git repository has three components:

Working Directory: The actual files reside here.
Index: The area used for staging
Head: Points to the most recent commit

## Checking file status


## We learned about Git as a Distributed Version Control
A Distributed Version Control systems (DVCS) addresses the major vulnerability of the CVS: the server as a single point of failure. If a CVS goes down, collaborators cannot work with each other on a file or save changes and new versions. Also, in the event of corruption of a central database’s hard disk — with the absence of backups — all work will be lost, except for any portions on local machines.

Git is a DVCS that stores data in a file system made up of snapshots. Each time you save a changed version of your project — called commit — Git creates a snapshot of the file and stores a reference to it. If the file has not changed, Git only stores a reference to the already-stored identical version of it.
